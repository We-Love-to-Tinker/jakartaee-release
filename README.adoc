=== batch-create-issues

Creates issues in multiple EE4J repositories based on provided template.
Anybody can create issues, but you will need to be a committer to modify the issue after it's been created (ie. labels, milestones, etc).

Usage:

- Modify `repos` list in `create_issues.sh` with names of repositories you want to create an issue in
- Put your issue text in `issue.md` file.
- The Title of the issue is generated via the `create_issues.sh` script.
An alternative is to include the Title as the first line in the `issue.md` file.
An empty line after that first Title line is required.
- Run `create_issues.sh`
